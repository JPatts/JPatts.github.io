          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="bio-text">
            Hello, I'm a senior at Portland State University. Welcome to my
            personal website. This website exists to showcase my résumé and
            various projects, school-related, and personal.
          </p>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="bio-text">
            Born and raised in California I moved up to Oregon as soon as I
            could in order to escape the heat and enjoy forrests. After
            attending Portland Community College for sometime I relocated to the
            Oregon coast for several years. Later I decided to go back to school
            and thus moved back to Portland and in 2020 I enrolled in Portland
            State's Computer Science Bachelors of Science program.
