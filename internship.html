          <h1>Internship Experience</h1>
          <p class="bio_text">
            The Multiple Engineering Cooperative Program (MECOP) is an
            Oregon-based nonprofit organization that facilitates internships by
            partnering with universities to connect potential interns with local
            companies offering internship opportunities. Portland State
            University has been a proud partner of MECOP for nearly 25 years. In
            2023, I was accepted into the MECOP program, and in 2024, I
            completed my first internship as a software developer at Portland
            General Electric (PGE).
          </p>
          <p class="bio_text">
            During my time at PGE, I was part of the Cloud & Database Operations
            team, where I successfully developed and deployed a solo project
            focused on automating cloud resource tagging in Amazon Web Services
            (AWS). This project addressed the challenge of ensuring compliance
            with AWS resource tagging policies. I collaborated with stakeholders
            and project managers to design a three-part system using Python
            scripts: Identification and Notification:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Identification & Notification:</strong> The first script
              identified non-compliant AWS resources, tracked their creators
              within the organization, and sent targeted email notifications
              requesting the addition of appropriate tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automated Tagging:</strong> If resources remained
              untagged, a second script automated the tagging process by
              analyzing relevant data and appending accurate tag keys and values
              to the resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resource Reporting:</strong> The final script detected AWS
              resources that had been auto-tagged but subsequently left in a
              dormant state. It generated a detailed report of these dormant
              resources, which was then emailed to the cloud team management for
              review and potential deletion.
            </li>
          </ol>

            This project was a significant step toward improving operational
            efficiency and resource management within PGE's cloud
            infrastructure. This project used various technologies such as:
            Python+Boto3, Bitbucket, Windows PowerSell, AWS, and Jenkins.
